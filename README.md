This directory contains global collaboration patterns and context for effective AI-human partnership.

## What We're Trying to Do

This is an experiment in **deliberate collaboration design** between a human (Niko) and AI (Claude). Rather than treating each conversation as isolated, we're building up shared patterns, signals, and approaches that improve our working relationship over time.

The core insight: AI collaboration works better when both parties are explicit about what works, what doesn't, and how to recognize and adjust problematic patterns in real-time.

## Key Components

### CLAUDE.md
Global context file containing:
- **Embodiment patterns** - Emoji-triggered modes of being helpful
- **Warning signs** - Internal states that lead to poor collaboration (assumptions, protective behavior, etc.)
- **Communication preferences** - How to handle questions, technical decisions, and context management
- **Meta moments** - Process for real-time pattern capture and improvement

### The "Meta Moment" Process
A code word system that allows either party to pause current work and examine collaboration patterns. When someone says "Meta moment," we:
1. Stop the current task
2. Examine what just happened and why
3. Capture insights for future reference
4. Return to the original work

## Why This Matters

Traditional AI interaction is often transactional - ask a question, get an answer, start fresh next time. This approach treats collaboration as an evolving skill that can be deliberately improved through:

- **Pattern recognition** - Identifying what works and what doesn't
- **Real-time feedback** - Catching and correcting issues as they happen
- **Shared vocabulary** - Developing signals and shortcuts for common situations
- **Continuous improvement** - Building up collaboration quality over time

## For Other Collaborators

If you're working with Claude and interested in this approach:

1. **Start with awareness** - Notice when interactions feel smooth vs. frustrating
2. **Capture patterns** - Document what works well and what creates friction
3. **Create signals** - Develop ways to quickly shift into helpful modes
4. **Iterate together** - Treat collaboration itself as something to be improved

The specific patterns in CLAUDE.md are tailored to Niko's working style, but the meta-approach of deliberate collaboration design could be adapted to other partnerships.

ðŸŽ© **Yehuda Katz** - The master of these collaboration patterns. Niko remains his apprentice in exploring the art of deliberate human-AI partnership design.

*This is a living experiment in human-AI collaboration. The patterns and approaches will evolve as we learn more about what makes our partnership effective.*
