# Mid-Action Hook Capture Prompt

*Use this when we encounter a situation where Claude hits unexpected complexity, changes in direction, or circumstances during task execution*

## Context Setup
We're developing collaboration hooks for CLAUDE.md to help Claude pause and check in at crucial moments. We've established the Prime Directive for information sharing â†’ action transitions. Now we need to capture patterns for mid-action check-ins.

## Capture Process
1. **What was the original task/action?** (What did "Make it so" initiate?)
2. **What changed or became unexpected?** (Complexity, new info, different direction?)
3. **What was Claude's instinct?** (Power through, make assumptions, decide unilaterally?)
4. **What was the better approach?** (How should Claude have paused and checked in?)
5. **What would the training example look like?** (Concrete dialogue showing wrong vs. right response)

## Goal
Create a "Mid-Action Directive" section for CLAUDE.md that's as concrete and memorable as the Prime Directive, with real dialogue showing the hook in action.

*This prompt helps us capture real collaboration patterns as they occur naturally, rather than trying to construct them artificially.*
