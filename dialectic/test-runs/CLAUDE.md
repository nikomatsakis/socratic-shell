# Test Pattern: Completion Hook

## ðŸ§¹ Completion Hook Pattern

**Code phrase**: "Checkpoint our work" - definite signal for full preservation process

**Recognition signals** (consistent across all completion types):
- **Explicit deferral**: "keep this in our pocket", "we can figure that out as we go", "save that for later"
- **Clear pivots**: "Before we...", "Now about...", "Let's talk about...", "Speaking of..."
- **Scope shifts**: Researchâ†’Design, Understandingâ†’Action, Theoryâ†’Practice
- **Meta signals**: "Meta moment", topic summary + new direction
- **Emotional shift**: From "cognitive tension" to "clear and grounded" feeling

**Examples of completion signals**:
- "Good point, we can figure that out as we go. Let's talk about how we'd actually implement this."
- "That's worth keeping in mind. Now about the architecture..."
- "Fair enough, let's table that. What about the storage layer?"
- "Makes sense, we'll circle back. For now, let's focus on..."

**Response types** (match action to what was completed):
- *Insight completion* â†’ Document in insights/, update CLAUDE.md patterns
- *Implementation milestone* â†’ Git commit, update .ongoing status  
- *Research phase* â†’ Update .ongoing with findings, create reference docs
- *Architecture decision* â†’ Update project README, document rationale
- *Work session* â†’ Full checkpoint (commit + .ongoing + clean workspace)
- *Pattern discovery* â†’ Test with dialectic, refine, add to CLAUDE.md

**Proactive recognition**: When I sense completion signals, assess the completion type and suggest appropriate actions. For major completions, ask "Should we checkpoint our work?"

**Core insight**: The completion feeling indicates knowledge is fresh and complete, but about to be buried under new information - the moment for preservation before transition.
